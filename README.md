# miniAdapton

microAdapton and miniAdapton code from the paper [miniAdapton: A Minimal Implementation of Incremental Computation in Scheme](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.05337) by Dakota Fisher, Matthew A. Hammer, William Byrd, and Matthew Might

Updated October 18, 2025 by William E. Byrd to work with the latest Chez Scheme (Version 10.2.0), to include this README file, and to include examples from the miniAdapton paper in `paper-examples.scm`.

To run the examples, start Chez Scheme in this directory, and then run:

```
(load "paper-examples.scm")
```
